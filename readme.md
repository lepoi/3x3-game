# 3x3 game

This is a very simple game meant for didactive purposes.

It served as showing material for a workshop that I taught to a group of kids.

The game starts with an image selected randomdly, arranged in a random order, I provided 3 sample images.

The images are split into 3x3 grids using [imgonline.com's splitting tool](https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/cut-photo-into-pieces.php).
